It's just another psycho nightmare
So don't you forget
You've always been the teacher's pet

It's a tired and slow song baby
Don't be upset
Just rmember the future has not happend yet
Every shiny thing of good luck
Could be made true
Severy single thing you dream up could happen to you

It's just another worldwide broadcast
You better think fast
It's always the good times girl that really last
The lonely looney one inside of us all

You don't have to sit up to stand tall

Every little thing you joke of
Will be made brand new
Every living thing you speak of could become true
It's just another psycho nightmare
