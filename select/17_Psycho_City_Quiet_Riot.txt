I'm a hero to the sinner
Got a rep that I can't shake
Classify me lonely
Order at your own risk - can't cancel the pain
By moanin' and a groanin'
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Stay out if you can't stand the heat

Whatever you want - whatever you need
It's psycho city
They got a cure - that you'll prefer
In psycho city

You wanna have your cake and eat it
Middle of the road
The candle burns at both ends
You won't recover from a lover who tries to steal your fate
Ain't no use in running
Hard knocks - the school that you're running
Money talk - ever when you're comin'

Whatever you want - whatever you need
It's psycho city
They got a cure - that you'll prefer
In psycho city

Living in the city baby - living kinda lean
Fall between the cracks now baby
Hard to keep it clean
Everybody wants you lately - ain't no good at all
Look at all the crazies waiting for the chips to fall

Whatever you want - whatever you need
It's in the city
A magic cure - that you'll prefer
You'll find the thing that you want
You'll get everything that you need

Whatever you want - whatever you need
It's psycho city
They got a cure - that you'll prefer
In psycho city
