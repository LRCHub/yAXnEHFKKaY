[Sample: Rihanna - "Disturbia"]
[Intro:]
You can't ever in life call me crazy you know that right?
You did this song (Charles Hamilton)
[Verse 1:]
The other night I had a dream you was screaming in my right ear
Till my eyes and ears were bleeding
While you fight tears inflicting the pain
I watch a video of pretty hoes giving me brain
Now I ain't never seen the footage but you know it well
You force me to watch
When it's over you tell me to go to hell
My right ear leaking outside the right side of my brain
Thinking out loud night time is insane
Cause you hear me think
"Nice thighs on a dame"
Or why am I able to like "Why is my brain outside you psycho bitch? I'll kill you Psycho Bitch! "
You like this shit
Life isn't nothing but a vicodin overdose to you
Cause your so at peace
Just as long as you can find dishes to throw at me
I ain't crazy (laughs)
Yeah I know that seems like quite the antonym
Such is the life of Mr. Hamilton
[Chorus:]
I don't like your boyfriend baby call me jealous cause the nigga got you (and that sucks)
And I ain't got a girlfriend baby every other girl is simply not you (that ass)
I'm psychotically curious
(Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words)
I'm psychotically curious
(Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words)
[Verse 2:]
You had a dream that I grabbed your hair
Smacked your rear
Asked you for cash
You said "Yeah"
Passed me a stack
I tossed the cash in the air
Laughed and stared
You said "Right back at cha"
Slashed you with mascara
You mad scared
Cause I gave you a brutal hit
With a fuckin beauty utensil
Who could forget?
Now you got a nasty gash
Cause I spazzed
After askin for cash
And that's bad
Which is why neither of us can act mad (huh)
I swear if you don't murder me soon
One of us is gonna end up in the emergency room
The urgency dude
Never met a chick that dark,
Cupid never shot the dart
With some shit that sharp
And her eyes are not real
Them shits is like portals
Short hair, long legs
Guess I'm the tortoise
She's so clear my viewpoint is distorted
But take me to the bitch
It's important, it's morbid
[Chorus:]
I don't like your boyfriend baby call me jealous cause the nigga got you (and that sucks)
And I ain't got a girlfriend baby every other girl is simply not you (that ass)
I'm psychotically curious
(Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words)
I'm psychotically curious
(Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words)
[Verse 3:]
They say my life is bugged
Get turned on by the sight of blood
I adjust life with me
Is nothing like the life with us
I could light it up
I write enough
But I can't write enough
To show you how the sky is dust
Ain't nobody high as us
But you think I'm high as fuck
Nah I'm low to the ground
Holdin it down
Love is a disease goin around
I'm quarantine, more than meets the eye
No more of me I jordan leap to the sky
"I'm outta here! " (Great)
Now I'm out of disturbia
You got some real power why did I doubt you workin much?
Thousands of burners adjusted to Chris
Or just by turning up this shit
This verb is fuckin sick
I mean action word
Like "go" "sit" "down" "stand"
Do what I fuckin say I'm better than your man
You better write a letter to your man
Tell him you ran off with a better man
I'll fuckin sever his hands
He can't touch me
[Chorus:]
I don't like your boyfriend baby call me jealous cause the nigga got you (and that sucks)
And I ain't got a girlfriend baby every other girl is simply not you (that ass)
I'm psychotically curious
(Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words)
I'm psychotically curious
(Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words, Nice choice of words)
[Outro:]
Whoo!
Charles Hamilton
You gotta say it mad cute
This beat is fuckin' UGLY!
Nothing more beautiful than you though
I just wanna let you know I'm crazy too
Muah
(I'm sorry, Rihanna, Rihanna)
(I'm sorry, Rihanna, Rihanna)
(I'm sorry, Rihanna, Rihanna)
(I'm sorry, Rihanna, Rihanna)
