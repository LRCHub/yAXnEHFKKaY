Found myself inside an empty room
Waiting for the beast to make a move
Riding through the TV air
The devil makes his playground anywhere

One day, little baby, don't you be surprised but I'll be gone
You know that's true

Meantime all my friends are coming down
Overshooting exits out of town
Trapped in cans inside of traffic stacks
As the bright lights call them back
To Psycho City
To Psycho City

Aome day if the smoke clears from your eye
You'll recognise your helter skelter life

One day, little baby, you're going to realise right from wrong
It'll come right you

Meanwhile as the band is going on
Double crossing dodges get it on
Complicating every little fact
Don't ever turn your back
On Psycho City
On Psycho City

Some day as I make my way by song
I'll find out where I should belong
Jump my wheels right off the twisted track
'Cause I'm never going back
To Psycho City
To Psycho City
To Psycho City
Psycho City
